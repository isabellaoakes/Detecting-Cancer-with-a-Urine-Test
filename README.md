# Detecting Cancer with a Urine Test

## Completed: 06/26/2021

## Project Objective
Our objective is to use data collected by Silvana Debernardi and colleagues to create a model using urinary biomarkers to help detect pancreatic cancer, an extremely deadly form of cancer.

## Project Description
Using four urinary biomarkers as well as age, sex, plasma CA19 level, and creatinine level we generated six models: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, Neural Network, XGBoost, and a penalized logistic model. The random forest model produced the highest metric levels and an R Shiny app was created using this model to predict cancer diagnosis by inputting values for each variable.
